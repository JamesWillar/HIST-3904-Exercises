Module 2 The Dream Case

Search for "Willar". I found absolurely nothing. Apparently I do not have any connections on my dad's side to lost soldiers in the wars.

Search for "Roberts". 4477 records match the search criteria! I was expecting a large number but this is huge.

I downloaded them into an excel sheet and then uploaded onto google spreadsheets so it can be shared:

The format that the site gives you is very useful for browsing and looking for any specifics. Obviously my search is quite broad but if I knew of a specific regiment or a better name to look for, it could be much better.
