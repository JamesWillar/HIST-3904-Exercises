emigrating to that land of large promise, and, as some allege, of lean performance. We mean to devote the present article consideration of a single feature in the picture of American society given by our authors, and ou which, as it stands revealed to us in these volumes in all its deformity, we are anxious to fix the regards of our readers, We allude to the NEGRO SLAVERY which pervades a great part of the United States="United States" ref=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States.</p> <p> The most copious view both of the legal and actual condition of the slave, as it exists in the United States, is to be found in the work of Mr. Hall. It is true, as this intelligent writer observes, that information on their actual state, whether in law or fact, is little attainable by a cursory traveller. The planter, of course, will not present himself for examination, with his memorandum book of the stripes and tortures he has inflicted, and of the groans which have followed. If he affords any information at all on the subject, it passes through a doubly distorted medium. As a planter, he is interested in concealing the evils, and still more the enormities, of Negro servitude; while, as an American, he is naturally anxious to vindicate the national.character in the eyes of a foreigner. Add to this, that the testimony of the slave himself would gain no credit from the enemies to his freedom; whilst it is almost impossible that the passing traveller, or the occasional guest, should himself witness much of the practical operation of a system, the most odious and frightful part of which is necessarily withdrawn from the public eye. In general, therefore, the traveller has it only in his power to delineate such broad outlines as are incapable of concealment, leaving them to be filled up by means of those fair inductions which, on the admitted principles of human nature, we are authorized to draw from the undisputed facts of the case. And this is all which Mr. Hall or indeed Mr. Fearon, professes to do. </p> <p> The law by which slaves, and even free Men of Colour, are governed in the Carolines - and Mr. Hall believes that the same or a similar code prevails in all the slave states - is a provincial act passed in 1740, and made perpetual in 1783. It begins with an enactment justly and feelingly stigmatized by our author as a "heart-chilling declaration." It is as follows : "whereas, in His Majesty's plantations, &c. slavery has been allowed, be it enacted, that all Negroes, Mulattoes, &c. who are or shall hereafter be in this province, and all their issues and offspring, born and to be born, shall

 I wasn't able to format it int the right way but I did see how digitizing a document like this could lead to easier research for not just myself, but people after me who are looking into the same subject. It makes everything easier to search for and referencing purposes. Not my best exercise.
